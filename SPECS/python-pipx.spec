## Overview
* Safely install packages to isolated virtual environments, while globally exposing their CLI applications so you can run them from anywhere
* Easily list, upgrade, and uninstall packages that were installed with pipx
* Run the latest version of a CLI application from a package in a temporary virtual environment, leaving your system untouched after it finishes
* Run binaries from the `__pypackages__` directory per PEP 582 as companion tool to [pythonloc](https://github.com/cs01/pythonloc)
* Runs with regular user permissions, never calling `sudo pip install ...` (you aren't doing that, are you? ðŸ˜„).

pipx combines the features of JavaScript's [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) - which ships with npm - and Python's [pipsi](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi). pipx does not ship with pip but it is an important part of bootstrapping your system.

### Safely installing to isolated environments
You can globally install a CLI application by running
```
pipx install PACKAGE
```

This automatically creates a virtual environment, installs the package, and adds the package's CLI entry points to a location on your `PATH`. For example, `pipx install cowsay` makes the `cowsay` command available globally, but sandboxes the cowsay package in its own virtual environment. **pipx never needs to run as sudo to do this.**

Example:
```
>> pipx install cowsay
  installed package cowsay 2.0, Python 3.6.7
  These binaries are now globally available
    - cowsay
done!

### Running in temporary, sandboxed environments
pipx makes running the latest version of a program in a one-time environment as easy as
```
pipx run BINARY [ARGS...]
```
This will install the package in a temporary directory and invoke the binary. Try it!

```
pipx run cowsay moo
```

Notice that you **don't need to execute any install commands to run the binary**. Re-running the same binary is quick because pipx caches Virtual Environments on a per-binary basis. These caches last two days.

You can run .py files directly, too.
```
pipx run https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cs01/fa721a17a326e551ede048c5088f9e0f/raw/6bdfbb6e9c1132b1c38fdd2f195d4a24c540c324/pipx-demo.py
pipx is working!
```
