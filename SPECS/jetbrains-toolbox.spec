Manage product updates with ease

The pace of technologies and software updates is ever-accelerating. Stay
up-to-date without compromising your productivity with the Toolbox App: easily
maintain several versions of the same tool, install updates, and roll them back
instantly if needed.


Multiple product versions and EAPs

Toolbox App makes handling several versions of a product easy and painless. No
more worries about where to install or how to remove your favorite tool.
Curious enough to try new features? Toolbox supports Early Access Programs too.


All your projects â€” in one place

The Toolbox App knows which IDE you use for which project. It shows all your
projects in one list with one-click open action inside the right IDE, and in
its right version if you have several installed. Even if you use a single IDE
and have multiple projects, the Toolbox App will save you clicks opening them.


Login only once and for all

The Toolbox app remembers your JetBrains Account and uses it to automatically
log you into other tools you install.
