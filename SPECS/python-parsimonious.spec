%description
Parsimonious aims to be the fastest arbitrary-lookahead parser written in pure
Pythonâ€”and the most usable. It's based on parsing expression grammars (PEGs),
which means you feed it a simplified sort of EBNF notation. Parsimonious was
designed to undergird a MediaWiki parser that wouldn't take 5 seconds or a GB
of RAM to do one page, but it's applicable to all sorts of languages.
